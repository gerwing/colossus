Simple Java Plain Text Encryption Tool


Collossus is a very simple tool that can generate a secret key which can then be used to Encrypt and Decrypt plain text.
The algorithm for this encryyption is based on DES and Blowfish. 

This little program was written for the Information and Security module at London Metropolitan Uni during my MSc.
